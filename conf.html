      <p>
        I've kept it hidden, deep within my heart,<br>
        This feeling I have, I just can't depart.<br>
        Every time I see you, my heart skips a beat,<br>
        And I know the time has come for me to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know it's scary, but I must be brave,<br>
        To reveal my feelings, I must find a way.<br>
        So here I am, standing before you,<br>
        With a heart overflowing, and a love so true.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope you see, the passion I hold,<br>
        And understand the story that must be told.<br>
        That you are special, and mean the world to me,<br>
        And with you by my side, my heart will always be free.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here is my confession, I hope you see,<br>
        That I've fallen in love, and it's all because of thee.<br>
        And now I wait, with bated breath,<br>
        For your reply, and what lies ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a moment, I'll never forget,<br>
        And I hope that our love will never regret.<br>
        So I'll leave it in your hands, and pray you'll understand,<br>
        That confessing my love, was the best thing I ever planned.
      </p>
